    "longDescription": "If you are interested in Python and Tkinter, you have probably noticed that although there is some good contributed documentation on the Web, there is not enough to get Tkinter applications up and running. Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning's web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.",
