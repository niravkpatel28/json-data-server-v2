    "longDescription": "Practical Methods for Your Year 2000 Problem gives the Year 2000 project team a step-by-step methodology for addressing the Year 2000 problem. By seeking to minimize the amount of work to be performed, and thus maximize the probability of having a successful Year 2000 project, the book is geared towards (a) helping the inhouse personnel understand, scope and, execute their project while (b) removing the need to spend large amounts of money on professional consulting firms. The VisualAge 2000 toolset by IBM is used for examples.    Practical Methods for Your Year 2000 Problem identifies what you need to look for, how you need to look at it, and what to do with what you see. No other book or company in the market today provides a solution as comprehensive and cost-effective as this. Starting with the clear, concise, and unambiguous definitions of what dates are and how programs and files relate to them, the book goes on to describe how to change them to be useful forever, not just up to the next century.    Finally, Practical Methods for Your Year 2000 Problem gives practical and comprehensive advice on all aspects of the Year 2000 problem, from inventorying software and hardware through to implementing large numbers of interrelated programs, files, and tables.",
