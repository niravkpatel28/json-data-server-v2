    "longDescription": "Open source tools provide a powerful and flexible environment for web development and maintenance. If your site has complex business rules or server logic, then you need more than just an interface builder. You need a strong application language with effective tools ready at hand. Perl's strengths make it a natural choice.    Did you know you can easily build a site with features like message forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other features your users will love  This book shows you how. But it is more than a programming book. It covers a wide spectrum of practical issues and how to handle them, such as when to use a database, what information needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep traffic from crippling your site. It will teach you the empowering use of ready-made modules so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. And it will even teach you how to successfully advocate the use of Open Source tools in your company.",
