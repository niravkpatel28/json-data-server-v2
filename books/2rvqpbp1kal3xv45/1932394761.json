    "longDescription": "Reports are the lifeline of business, so a good reporting environment is a big deal. With a powerful tool like Microsoft Reporting Services, .NET developers can add reporting to any type of application, regardless of its target platform or development language. Greatly improved for SQL Server 2005, Reporting Services now provides tighter integration with SQL Server, improved developer tools, and an expanded array of options to empower end users.    SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services in Action helps you build and manage flexible reporting solutions and develop report-enabled applications. In this clear, well-illustrated book, you  ll follow a report from creation to publication. Along the way you  ll explore flexible delivery options like web-based, on-demand, and subscribed reports   complete with cool new features like direct printing and client-side sorting.    For applications that require custom reporting, you'll learn to define reports with RDL and push them to the Report Server using the Report Manager Web Service API. You  ll also see how to write server extensions to expand the range of data processing and report delivery options.    Written for developers with a solid foundation in .NET and SQL Server.",
