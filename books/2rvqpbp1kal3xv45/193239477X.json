    "longDescription": "The static Web is going out of style. Its click-and-wait user experience is giving way to dynamic personalized content and intuitive interactions. With ASP 2.0, a web developer can compose a page out of separate working parts \"Web Parts\" that independently communicate with the server to produce rich interactive portals like Yahoo!, Google/ig, and Live.com. The new Web Parts API makes it easy to centrally manage a portal's parts.    ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts in Action is packed with annotated code, diagrams, and crystal-clear discussions. You'll develop a sample project from design to deployment, adding content zones, personalization, and a custom look-and-feel. Since any website is invariably a work-in-progress, you'll appreciate learning how to upgrade your portals on the fly. Along the way you'll pick up handy code instrumentation techniques and a few tricks to help your portals manage themselves. As an added bonus, the book introduces the Microsoft Ajax Library (\"Atlas\") and shows how you can add Ajax to a web part. You  ll even create a Live.com gadget.    This book is for web developers familiar with ASP.NET.",
