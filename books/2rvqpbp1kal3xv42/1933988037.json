    "longDescription": "Common Ajax tasks should be easy, and with Prototype and Scriptaculous they are. Prototype and Scriptaculous are libraries of reusable JavaScript code that simplify Ajax development. Prototype provides helpful methods and objects that extend JavaScript in a safe, consistent way. Its clever Ajax request model simplifies cross-browser development. Scriptaculous, which is based on Prototype, offers handy pre-fabricated widgets for rich UI development.    Prototype and Scriptaculous in Action is a comprehensive, practical guide that walks you feature-by-feature through the two libraries. First, you   ll use Scriptaculous to make easy but powerful UI improvements. Then you   ll dig into Prototype   s elegant and sparse syntax. See how a few characters of Prototype code can save a dozen lines of JavaScript. By applying these techniques, you can concentrate on the function and flow of your application instead of the coding details. This book is written for web developers with a working knowledge of JavaScript.",
