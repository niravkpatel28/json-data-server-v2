    "longDescription": "Ajax gives web developers the potential to create rich user-centered Internet applications. But Ajax also adds a new level of complexity and sophistication to those applications. Ajax in Practice tackles Ajax head-on, providing countless hands-on techniques and tons of reusable code to address the specific issues developers face when building Ajax-driven solutions.    After a brief overview of Ajax, this book takes the reader through dozens of working examples, presented in an easy-to-use cookbook format. Readers will learn how to implement drag-and-drop interfaces and discover how to create effective navigation strategies for their applications. Unlike a traditional cookbook, Ajax in Practice provides a thorough discussion of each technique presented and shows how the individual components can be connected to create powerful solutions. A fun \"mash-up\" chapter concludes the book. Throughout the book, the examples chosen are interesting, entertaining, and practical.    With this book you will:  Go beyond what Ajax is and learn how to put Ajax to work.  Master numerous techniques for user interface design and site navigation.  Work hands-on with professional-grade reusable Ajax code designed to solve real problems.",
