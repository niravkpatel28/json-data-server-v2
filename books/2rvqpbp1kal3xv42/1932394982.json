    "longDescription": "Wicket bridges the mismatch between the web's stateless protocol and Java's OO model. The component-based Wicket framework shields you from the HTTP under a web app so you can concentrate on business problems instead of the plumbing code. In Wicket, you use logic-free HTML templates for layout and standard Java for an application's behavior. The result  Coding a web app with Wicket feels more like regular Java programming.    Wicket in Action is a comprehensive guide for Java developers building Wicket-based web applications. It introduces Wicket's structure and components, and moves quickly into examples of Wicket at work. Written by core committers, this book shows you the \"how-to\" and the \"why\" of Wicket. You'll learn to use and customize Wicket components, to interact with Spring and Hibernate, and to implement rich Ajax-driven features.",
