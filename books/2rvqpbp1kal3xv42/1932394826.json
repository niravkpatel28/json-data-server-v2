    "longDescription": "Unlike some complex and invasive persistence solutions, iBATIS keeps O/RM clean and simple. It is an elegant persistence framework that maps classes to SQL statements and keeps the learning curve flat. The iBATIS approach makes apps easy to code, test, and deploy. You write regular SQL and iBATIS gives you standard objects for persistence and retrieval. There   s no need to change existing database schemas   iBATIS is tolerant of legacy databases (even badly designed ones).    iBATIS in Action is a comprehensive tutorial on the framework and an introduction to the iBATIS philosophy. Clinton Begin and coauthors lead you through the core features, including configuration, statements, and transactions. Because you   ll need more than the basics, it explores sophisticated topics like Dynamic SQL and data layer abstraction. You   ll also learn a useful skill: how to extend iBATIS itself. A complete, detailed example shows you how to put iBATIS to work. Topics are clearly organized and easily accessible for reference.",
