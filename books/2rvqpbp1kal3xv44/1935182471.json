    "longDescription": "C# has changed since it was first introduced   a lot! With generics, lambda expressions, dynamic typing, LINQ, iterator blocks and many other features, C# is more expressive than ever. However, you can't get the most out of the language unless you know it in depth.    C# in Depth, Second Edition concentrates on the high-value features that make C# such a powerful and flexible development tool. Rather than re-hashing the core of C# that's essentially unchanged since it hit the scene nearly a decade ago, this book brings you up to speed with the features and practices that have changed with C# from version 2.0 onwards.    This totally revamped Second Edition is bang up to date, covering the new features of C# 4 as well as Code Contracts. In it, you'll master the subtleties of C#, learning how to tame the trickier bits and apply them to best advantage. Along the way you'll find out how to avoid hidden pitfalls and go \"behind the scenes\" to ensure you don't get nasty surprises.",
