    "longDescription": "The future of high-end web development on the Microsoft platform, ASP.NET MVC 2 provides clear separation of data, interface, and logic and radically simplifies tedious page and event lifecycle management. And since it's an evolution of ASP.NET, you can mix MVC and Web Forms in the same application, building on your existing work.    ASP.NET MVC 2 in Action is a fast-paced tutorial designed to introduce the MVC model to ASP.NET developers and show how to apply it effectively. After a high-speed ramp up, the book presents over 25 concise chapters exploring key topics like validation, routing, and data access. Each topic is illustrated with its own example so it's easy to dip into the book without reading in sequence. This book covers some high-value, high-end techniques you won't find anywhere else!    Microsoft ASP.NET MVC (model/view/controller) is a relatively new Web application framework that combines ASP.NET's power and ease of use with the stability and testability of a MVC framework. The much-anticipated version 2 release brings new capabilities to the framework along with numerous additions that enhance developer productivity. In ASP.NET MVC 2 in Action, readers learn how to move from web form-based development to designs based on the MVC pattern. It begins with an introduction to the MVC framework and quickly dives into a working MVC 2 project.    Featuring full coverage of new version 2 features, this book helps readers use developer-oriented upgrades like \"Areas\" to break a large project into smaller pieces and explore the new data handling tools. This revised edition adds a completely new tutorial to bring developers with no prior exposure to the MVC pattern up to speed quickly, keeping its focus on providing high-quality, professional grade examples that go deeper than the other ASP.NET MVC books.",
