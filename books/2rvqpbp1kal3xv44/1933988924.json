You'll see how the functional way of thinking changes the game for .NET developers. Then, you'll tackle common issues using a functional approach. The book will also teach you the basics of the F# language and extend your C# skills into the functional domain. No prior experience with functional programming or F# is required.",
    "longDescription": "Functional programming languages are good at expressing complex ideas in a succinct, declarative way. Functional concepts such as \"immutability\" and \"function values\" make it easier to reason about code   as well as helping with concurrency. The new F# language, LINQ, certain new features of C#, and numerous .NET libraries now bring the power of functional programming to .NET coders.    This book teaches the ideas and techniques of functional programming applied to real-world problems. You'll see how the functional way of thinking changes the game for .NET developers. Then, you'll tackle common issues using a functional approach. The book will also teach you the basics of the F# language and extend your C# skills into the functional domain. No prior experience with functional programming or F# is required.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Thinking the functional way      * Blending OO and functional programming      * Effective F# code",
