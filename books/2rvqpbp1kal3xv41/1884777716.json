    "longDescription": "Java on the server is here to stay. Whether you're using J2EE or writing your own, you will need to understand the fundamental concepts of server-based Java. Server-Based Java Programming teaches those concepts of Java that underlie the J2EE APIs and the best ways to use them. An ongoing focus on the full lifecycle, including administration and deployment, makes this book a rare, practical guide. One of its themes is the theoretical \"three-zeroes\" goal for server development--zero development, zero administration, and zero deployment.    Server-Based Java Programming isn't just about implementation--it's also about architecture, and design. You'll learn how to write the code that sustains a cutting-edge enterprise. You will learn nuts-and-bolts topics like ClassLoaders, threads, CORBA, RMI/IIOP, and JNI, as well as how to make each of these contribute to enterprise-wide goals such as fault-tolerance, easier system administration, five-nine availability, deployment without headaches, and lower development costs.",
