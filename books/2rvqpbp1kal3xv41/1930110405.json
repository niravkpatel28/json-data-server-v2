    "longDescription": "LDAP is the leading Internet protocol for directory-like information: user identities, preferences, security privileges. etc. Because it is popular, most programming languages have handy extensions for searching and updating LDAP directories. But most information today is still locked away in application-specific repositories that lack LDAP access.    LDAP Programming, Management and Integration explains how to link non-LDAP data with LDAP directories. It starts with a concise introduction to the LDAP standard and discusses how to work with it in Java and Perl. It gives you practical code and advice for migrating and integrating data into an LDAP environment. And it explains how to increase your application's security using identity and profile information from LDAP repositories.    Written for programmers and system administrators, this book teaches clearly and honestly the LDAP practiced  in the trenches.  It is concise yet rich in practical examples that make a sometimes complex subject easy to understand.",
