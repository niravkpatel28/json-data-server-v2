    "longDescription": "Although CGI scripts provide 80% of today's server side processing, they are slow, inefficient, and memory-hungry. A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions. However, the book is detailed enough that it may also serve as a reference for the developer.",
