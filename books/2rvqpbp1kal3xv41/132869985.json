    "longDescription": "OK, so you use the Internet. You've surfed some Web sites and maybe sent e-mail. But, chances are, you've overlooked the rich and really personal dimension of the Internet represented by the explosive growth of Internet BBSs. That's because up till now BBS publications were limited in scope to the old era of dial-up BBSs.    Until recently the world of BBSs was geographically compartmentalized: in practical terms only the BBSs within a local telphone call were accessible. Now, the Internet has made all Internet BBSs accessible to anyone in the world. Internet BBSs: A Guided Tour provides in-depth coverage of this new world of true BBSs now available world-wide. It is a valuable resource for anyone currently using the Internet. Users of the major on-line service forums and chat groups should also read it to find out how they can access a much richer variety of BBSs at less cost.",
