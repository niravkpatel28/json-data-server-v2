    "longDescription": "Most textbooks concentrate on presenting the theory, concepts, and products, with examples of implementations in some cases. The distinctive quality of SNA and TCP/IP Enterprise Networking is in its structure. It answers not only \"What \", \"Why \", and \"How \", but also \"What's next \". It shows the reader how enterprise networking evolved, what approaches and techniques can be used today, and where tomorrow's trends lie, illustrating among others Web-to-SNA connectivity and Java based integration approaches.    SNA and TCP/IP Enterprise Networking was written by visionaries, scientists, networking product developers, industry experts, consultants, and end-user representatives, who not only implement the products but also participate in definition of open networking standards. It should be equally appealing to the network practitioners implementing technology as the senior managers making strategic decisions on enterprise networking.",
