    "longDescription": "Maximum MIDI shows you how to build world-class MIDI programs that can play music using computer sound cards or external keyboard instruments, teach music theory and technique, add music to games and allow musicians to record, edit, play and print compositions. Maximum MIDI gives programmers two ways to add MIDI to their programs. A flexible toolkit of C and C++ routines makes developing Windows 95 MIDI programs a breeze, and rock-solid algorithms and tons of field-tested source code allow advanced users to quickly \"roll their own\"--on any platform. Over a dozen example programs show how it's done.    NEW! The Maximum MIDI Programmer's ToolKit now supports both Windows 95 and Windows NT. Popular demand, insomnia, and caffeine have finally convinced Paul to port the ToolKit to NT. Your copy of Maximum MIDI: Music Applications in C++ entitles you to download the updated 95/NT DLLs (including source code) from the Maximum MIDI website. The new code--and ToolKit support via the book's Author Online forum--is only available to owners of the book.",
