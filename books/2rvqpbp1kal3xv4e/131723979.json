    "longDescription": "This first book on the union of two rapidly growing approaches to programming--visual programming and object technology--provides a window on a subject of increasing commercial importance. It is an introduction and reference for cutting-edge developers, and for researchers, students, and enthusiasts interested in the design of visual OOP languages and environments.  Visual Object-Oriented Programming includes chapters on both emerging research and on a few classic systems, that together can help those who design visual object-oriented programming systems avoid some known pitfalls. The book contains an experience report on the use of available visual programming languages in a commercial setting, and chapters, by some of the leaders of this cutting-edge subject, covering systems such as Prograph, VIPR, PURSUIT, ThingLab II, Vampire, Forms/3, Self's environment, Vista, SPE, and Cerno.",
