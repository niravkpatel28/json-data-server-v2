    "longDescription": "With Java Management Extensions (JMX), you can configure, manage and monitor your Java applications at run-time, as well as break your applications into components that can be swapped out. JMX provides a window into an application's state and its behavior, and a protocol-independent way of altering both state and behavior. It lets you expose portions of your application in just a few lines of code.    Written for both new and experienced developers, this book explains the JMX specification and discusses its use through clean, well-discussed examples. It covers the JMX architecture and how to create all types of MBeans. It includes important advanced topics such as extending the JMX classes, combining with other Java technologies, the MBean relation service, dynamic MBean loading, and creating your own protocol adapters.",
