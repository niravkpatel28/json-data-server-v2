    "longDescription": "SWT and JFace are Eclipse's graphical libraries. They enable you to build nimble and powerful Java GUIs--but this is only the beginning. With Draw2D and the Graphical Editing Framework, you can go beyond static applications and create full-featured editors. And with the Rich Client Platform, you can build customized workbenches whose capabilities far exceed those of traditional interfaces.    SWT/JFace in Action covers the territory, from simple widgets to complex graphics. It guides you through the process of developing Eclipse-based GUIs and shows how to build applications with features your users will love. The authors share their intimate knowledge of the subject with you in a friendly, readable style.    This book encourages you to learn through action. Each topic provides extensive code to show you how SWT/JFace works in practical applications. Not only do these examples help you understand the subject, they are a working set of programs you can reuse in your own interfaces.",
