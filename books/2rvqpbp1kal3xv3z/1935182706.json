    "shortDescription": "Scala in Depth is a unique new book designed to help you integrate Scala effectively into your development process. By presenting the emerging best practices and designs from the Scala community, it guides you though dozens of powerful techniques example by example. There's no heavy-handed theory here-just lots of crisp, practical guides for coding in Scala.    For example:        * Discover the \"sweet spots\" where object-oriented and functional programming intersect.      * Master advanced OO features of Scala, including type member inheritance, multiple inheritance and composition.      * Employ functional programming concepts like tail recursion, immutability, and monadic operations.      * Learn good Scala style to keep your code concise, expressive and readable.    As you dig into the book, you'll start to appreciate what makes Scala really shine. For instance, the Scala type system is very, very powerful; this book provides use case approaches to manipulating the type system and covers how to use type constraints to enforce design constraints. Java developers love Scala's deep integration with Java and the JVM Ecosystem, and this book shows you how to leverage it effectively and work around the rough spots.",
    "longDescription": "Scala is a unique and powerful new programming language for the JVM. Blending the strengths of the Functional and Imperative programming models, Scala is a great tool for building highly concurrent applications without sacrificing the benefits of an OO approach. While information about the Scala language is abundant, skilled practitioners, great examples, and insight into the best practices of the community are harder to find. Scala in Depth bridges that gap, preparing you to adopt Scala successfully for real world projects.
