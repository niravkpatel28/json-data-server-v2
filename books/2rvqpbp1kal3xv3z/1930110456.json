    "longDescription": "Java is a success. It is now used across the programming landscape, from embedded devices to enterprise-class distributed systems. As Java's use increases, the pressure grows for it to expand to meet the diverse needs of the developer communities. The latest edition of Java, JDK 1.4 (or J2SE 1.4), includes new features like a new I/O system, a persistent preferences framework, Java Web Start, and Java regular expressions.    This book lets experienced developers as well as novices learn JDK 1.4's new features quickly. It provides a clear exposition of the important new topics with plenty of well documented code. All the examples are substantial and solve real-world problems but aren't cluttered with unnecessary details. The new features are covered in a comprehensive and matter-of-fact way without digressions into philosophy or theory. After reading this book, a developer will be able to use Java's new features with confidence and skill.",
