    "shortDescription": "\"POJOs in Action is required reading for battle-weary EJB developers and for new developers who want to avoid the sins of the fathers by using lightweight frameworks.    -- C# Online.NET",
    "longDescription": "There is agreement in the Java community that EJBs often introduce more problems than they solve. Now there is a major trend toward lightweight technologies such as Hibernate, Spring, JDO, iBATIS, and others, all of which allow the developer to work directly with the simpler Plain Old Java Objects, or POJOs. Bowing to the new consensus, EJB 3 now also works with POJOs.    POJOs in Action describes these new, simpler, and faster ways to develop enterprise Java applications. It shows you how to go about making key design decisions, including how to organize and encapsulate the domain logic, access the database, manage transactions, and handle database concurrency.    Written for developers and designers, this is a new-generation Java applications guide. It helps you build lightweight applications that are easier to build, test, and maintain. The book is uniquely practical with design alternatives illustrated through numerous code example",
