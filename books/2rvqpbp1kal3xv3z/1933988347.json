    "longDescription": "EJB 2 is widely used but it comes at a cost   procedural, redundant code. EJB 3 is a different animal. By adopting a POJO programming model and Java 5 annotations, it dramatically simplifies enterprise development. A cool new feature, its Java Persistence API, creates a standard for object-relational mapping. You can use it for any Java application, whether inside or outside the EJB container. With EJB 3 you will create true object-oriented applications that are easy to write, maintain and extend.    EJB 3 in Action is a fast-paced tutorial for both novice and experienced Java developers. It will help you learn EJB 3 and the JPA quickly and easily. This comprehensive, entirely new EJB 3 book starts with a tour of the EJB 3 landscape. It then moves quickly into core topics like building business logic with session and message-driven beans. You   ll find four full chapters on the JPA along with practical code samples, design patterns, performance tuning tips, and best practices for building and deploying scalable applications.",
