    "longDescription": "Mule is a widely used open source enterprise service bus. It is standards based, provides easy integration with Spring and JBoss, and fully supports the enterprise messaging patterns collected by Hohpe and Woolf. You can readily customize Mule without writing a lot of new code.    Mule in Action covers Mule fundamentals and best practices. It is a comprehensive tutorial that starts with a quick ESB overview and then gets Mule to work. It dives into core concepts like sending, receiving, routing, and transforming data. Next, it gives you a close look at Mule's standard components and how to roll out custom ones. You'll pick up techniques for testing, performance tuning, BPM orchestration, and even a touch of Groovy scripting.    Written for developers, architects, and IT managers, the book requires familiarity with Java but no previous exposure to Mule or other ESBs.",
