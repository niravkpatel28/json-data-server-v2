    "longDescription": "Spring is a fresh breeze blowing over the Java landscape. Based on the principles of dependency injection, interface-oriented design, and aspect-oriented programming, Spring combines enterprise application power with the simplicity of plain-old Java objects (POJOs).    In this second edition, Spring in Action has been completely updated to cover the exciting new features of Spring 2.0. The book begins by introducing you to the core concepts of Spring and then quickly launches into a hands-on exploration of the framework. Combining short code snippets and an ongoing example developed throughout the book, it shows you how to build simple and efficient J2EE applications. You will see how to solve persistence problems, handle asynchronous messaging, create and consume remote services, build web applications, and integrate with most popular web frameworks. You will learn how to use Spring to write simpler, easier to maintain code so that you can focus on what really matters--your critical business needs.",
