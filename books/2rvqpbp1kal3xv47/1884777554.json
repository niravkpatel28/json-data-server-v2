    "longDescription": "PFC Programmers' Reference Manual provides information that should prove indispensible for the PowerBuilder programmer trying to learn the PowerBuilder Foundation Classes. It lists all of the objects and functions that they might use for a project with notes from the author on each function. Service-based architecture and appropriate object-oriented techniques are stressed throughout.    The more difficult objects and services are given special attention; these are the ones that are sure to enhance your image as an expert in this emerging technology. The text is written with the same easy-to-understand prose that has marked the PowerBuilder Dojo as one of the premier PowerBuilder sites worldwide.    At first, the programmer will find this book a comprehensive guide to the wide scope of these libraries. Later it will serve as a handy memory tool for finding exactly what is needed at implementation time.    The manager will find this book an invaluable source for understanding which tools are available for immediate implementation.    PFC Programmers' Reference Manual covers PowerBuilder version 6 as well as version 5",
