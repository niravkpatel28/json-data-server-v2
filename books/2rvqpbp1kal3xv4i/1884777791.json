    "longDescription": "Object Oriented Perl is designed to provide anyone who is familiar with the basics of regular Perl programming with a complete introduction to the object-oriented features of Perl. The book moves from the very simplest applications through advanced applications such as generic programming, multiple dispatch, and object-oriented persistence. Thus, it offers a much-needed resource for persons new to Perl, as well as new and valuable insights and techniques for even the most accomplished Perl programmers.    Beyond explaining the syntax and semantics of Perl's inbuilt object-oriented features, Object Oriented Perl explains how to apply those features in a wide range of programming techniques. Each technique is illustrated with complete examples.    Object Oriented Perl also discusses the latest relevant Perl modules, which are freely available and can greatly simplify object-oriented development in Perl. In particular, it examines the new standard \"fields\" module and the associated pseudo-hash construct.    No other book covers the topic of object-oriented software development in Perl in such breadth, to such depth, or in such a readable manner. Complete source code for Object Oriented Perl is available online to owners of the book.",
