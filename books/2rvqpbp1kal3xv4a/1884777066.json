    "longDescription": "Frameworks are object-oriented programming environments for vertical application areas. This book is the first to survey this exciting new technology, its concepts, and practical applications. Considered the next step in the evolution of OOP, framework technology is at the center stage of the software strategies of Taligent, IBM, HP, Microsoft, and Apple, among others. In spite of that, frameworks remain poorly understood, and are rarely covered in the literature. This book condenses practical experience and research ideas; explains exotic terminology so that a novice computer professional can quickly absorb it; is easy to read and conceptually crisp; and will be useful to many types of readers, from programmers to technical managers.    Object-Oriented Application Frameworks:  Covers real-world commercial and public-domain frameworks:  MacApp, ET++, Taligent's Frameworks, Unidraw, InterViews (precursor of Fresco), and Prograph  Illustrates how the technology is used in applications (e.g., MFC from Microsoft) and languages (e.g., Prograph from Prograph International)  Introduces and explains the ideas in plain English",
