This book discusses ATM as the key technology for transforming the enterprise network from data-only to an integrated data, voice, video, image and multimedia corporate infrastructure.    Previous books have covered ATM and client/server separately. This book, intended for networking professionals, is unique in its focus on the hows and whys of the inevitable marriage of these two technologies.",
