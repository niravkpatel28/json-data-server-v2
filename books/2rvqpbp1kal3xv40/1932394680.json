    "longDescription": "Anyone seeking to implement SOA Security is forced to dig through a maze of inter-dependent specifications and API docs that assume a lot of prior security knowledge on the part of readers. Getting started on a project is proving to be a huge challenge to practitioners. This book seeks to change that. It provides a bottom-up understanding of security techniques appropriate for use in SOA without assuming any prior familiarity with security topics.    Unlike most other books about SOA that merely describe the standards, this book helps readers learn through action, by walking them through sample code that illustrates how real life problems can be solved using the techniques and best practices described in the standards. It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time. This keeps the material covered useful for all readers except the most advanced.",
